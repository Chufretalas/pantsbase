# Pantsbase 👖

    "It's fine, I guess"

Think of pocketbase, you know? That awesome piece of software? Ok, so pantsbase is like that, but worse.

What I can offer you (at least when I feel it's time to put a 1.0 release here) is that it will work most of the time and that it will aways have as few dependencies as I feel is possible. 

If you ask me why focus on the dependency number, I would say that it is because I love go's standart library and want to learn more about it by doing this project. That said, have fun looking through this much loved mess of project 😁.
